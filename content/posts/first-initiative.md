I have been trying to create my own website for sometime now but never been able to finish it. Finally, this time I was determined and started this initiative.
I will try to post things that I face or experience every day. It could be technical challenges, social challenges, human aspects/views, or just something about life.
Another reason is to document useful things here, which are easy to forget so that I can just look into it whenever I need it.
