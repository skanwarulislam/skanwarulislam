From today 1st of October 2021, I am staring my parental leave (pappa permisjon) for next 5 months, which I was looking forward to (My wife won't agree :D). When my first son was 8 month, I moved to norway pursuing better future and missed all the good part about being a father.
I have missed my baby's first step, his first words, and the list goes on. Plus in bangladesh the parental leave for father was only 2 weeks and so after the birth there not much of live and family that you can cherish. The blessing of living in norway is that both parents need to take 15 weeks of mandatory parantal leave and 16 more weeks that they can share between them.
Trust me that is something unthinkable for many people in other countries. Anyway, I will stop bragging about good stuff in Norway :). Here is my plan I will try to post every day what me, and the little one (Avan) has done and our accomplishments and failures together :)
I am super excited about it :). I have tired to feed him baby gr√∏t (porridge) this evening it was a nightmare for me. I do not know how I will feed him if my wife start going to office :|. I will give it a try again tomorrow morning hopefully, this time he will not go nuts.
