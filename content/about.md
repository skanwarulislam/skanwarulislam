Hi! I am Anwar. I am a technology enthusiast with solid experience building and maintaining enterprise solutions into public cloud. I like to code and build stuff, it could be a complicated service, some automation script, a robust CI/CD pipelines or simple config changes. If makes me happy and gives me a test of achievement when I see those small things are adding value.
Nowadays I am interested in Authentication and Authorization and security aspects around it. It's indeed a exciting and interesting area. I am big fan of infrastructure as code. I also like to see monitoring matrices to learn more about the application and system to make it perform better. This is in short what I like, if you want to know more get in touch info@skanwarulislam.com
