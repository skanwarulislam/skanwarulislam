Hi! I am Anwar. I am a technology enthugist with solid experience building and maintaining enterprise solutions into public cloud. I like to build containerized micro services whenever its suitable.
Now a days I am interested in Authenicaiton and Authorization and security aspects around it. It's indeed a exciting and interesting area. I am big fan of infrasture as code. I also like to see monitoring matrics to learn more about the applicaition and system to make it perform better. This is in short what I like, if you want to know more get in touch info@skanwarulislam.com
